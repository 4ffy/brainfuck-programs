# Brainfuck Programs

This repository holds a collection of small programs that I have written in
[Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck). These are tested working on
the [copy.sh](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/) brainfuck interpreter. Programs with
a ```.rbf``` extension require the
[Random Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Random_Brainfuck) variant, which
should be trivial to implement into any interpreter that doesn't support it.
Most of these programs are in minified form without any meaningful
documentation, so they're really more to show off than to learn from.
