# Brainfuck Programs

This repository holds a collection of small programs that I have written in
[Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck). These are tested working on
the [copy.sh](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/) Brainfuck interpreter. Programs with
a ```.rbf``` extension require the
[Random Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Random_Brainfuck) variant, which
should be trivial to implement into any interpreter that doesn't support it.
Most of these programs are in minified form without any meaningful
documentation, so they're really more to show off than to learn from.

Here is the current list of programs. If a program takes input, there should be
a note at the top describing how it is used.
- ```calculate_e.bf``` - Calculate e.
- ```calculate_e_digits.bf``` - Calculate e, with controllable output length.
- ```dice_1d6.rbf``` - Roll a 6-sided die.
- ```dice_ndn.rbf``` - Perform an ndn dice roll.
- ```divide.bf``` - Divide two numbers and print the decimal result.
- ```is_even.bf``` - Determine whether a number is even or odd.
- ```length_of_input.bf``` - Print the length of the input string.
- ```rot13.bf``` - Ultra secure encryption.

If you would like to program nontrivial Brainfuck, check out this page on
[Brainfuck algorithms](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck_algorithms), which
has been invaluable to me.
